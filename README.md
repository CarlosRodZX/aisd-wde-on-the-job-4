## Project Description ðŸ“„

In this ongoing assignment, you'll experience what it's like to work as a web developer, building a website from the ground up using HTML and CSS. This project will guide you through the process of creating and styling a professional website, reinforcing your understanding of the foundational concepts of web development.

Throughout this assignment, you'll be tasked with building different sections of a website, each designed to introduce new HTML and CSS concepts. Youâ€™ll start with the basic structure using HTML, and as you progress, youâ€™ll enhance the siteâ€™s design and functionality with various CSS techniques and frameworks.

## Resources ðŸ“¦

Free stock images and videos can be downloaded at https://www.pexels.com.

Utilize documentation such as [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for all things related to HTML and CSS.

Use AI tools such as ChatGPT and Claude to help you learn. As you integrate AI tools into your learning process, it's essential to use them responsibly. AI can be a powerful resource to assist you, but itâ€™s important to ensure that you truly understand and engage with the content it generates. This will not only enhance your learning experience but also help you develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

## Checkpoint 4 âœ‹

### Bootstrap Makeover ðŸ“„

You will now take your existing web page that you have previously created and transform it using CSS Bootstrap. The goal is to enhance the design, responsiveness, and overall user experience by applying Bootstrapâ€™s grid system, components, and utilities. You will start by analyzing the current structure of your web page, then systematically integrate Bootstrap classes to achieve a modern, professional look.

This activity will challenge you to think critically about layout, component selection, and responsiveness as you apply Bootstrapâ€™s features to your design. By the end of this exercise, you will have a refined web page that not only looks better but also adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience across devices.

You have many options here. AI can take your existing code and apply Bootstrap to it but check to ensure that the outcome is what you want. You may have to followup to fix certain issues that may arise. If you go this route then be sure to only have AI convert small sections at a time (navbar, main content, etc) rather than the whole thing at once. Another option is to look at your existing code and have the AI generate something similar and then you apply your desired changes.

#### Deliverables âœ…

- [ ] Apply CSS Bootstrap to your web page.
- [ ] Ensure that your web page is responsive. As the window (screen) gets smaller the grid should adapt. Bootstrap should handle most of this automatically. You will need to apply breakpoints to any grid components.
